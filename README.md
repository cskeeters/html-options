# HTML Options

A boilerplate html page that can be populated with options where each option meets certain requirements and has a price.  When the page is viewed, the options will be displayed with the requirements that can be selected.  As the requirements are selected, options that don't meet the selected requirements are filtered out and the minimum price is updated.

Options should be entered in order of price so the cheapest is always on top.

Think of this as a Kayak-like interface for other choices.
